# CS305-SoftwareSecurity
This README discusses Project One, the vulnerability assessment report for Artenus Financial.
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
--


What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
--


Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
--


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
--


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
--


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
--
The dependency check tool will be useful for running on future Java applications, although I will likely alter the approach to be compatible with IntelliJ rather than Eclipse. Through the coding work, I've gotten slightly more familiar with coding RESTful APIs and their endpoints, which is a skill/topic I'm sure I will encounter repeatedly. I also know to consider frameworks and how they might assist me when approaching a task, since the Spring framework was used for most coding assignments.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would also express the problem-solving and collaboration that went into solving the NVD error for the Module 6 assignment--despite the frustration and hours of troubleshooting, I felt incredibly satisfied that, through collaboration, us students found a temporary working solution.
